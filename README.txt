This program uses binary tree and heaps to implement the Huffman coding scheme
There are three major steps:
1.Reading in a file and computing the frequency of characters in the file
2.Using these frequencies, build an Huffman encoding tree and encode the data file using it
3.Using the encoding of the data file and the Huffman tree, decode to obtain original data file
